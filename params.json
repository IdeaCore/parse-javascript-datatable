{"body":"### parse.com simple datatable starter kit.\r\n This is a simple flexible library that allows you to view and edit your parse.com data in a tabular format. You can set the table to be editable and/or deletable. For basic types the editing is very simple, you just click on the field and a little editor appears. For complex types and for large amounts of data in a single cell there are interceptor functions that allow you to handle the display of the data and the method for updating, e.g. for Date types you might intercept the up event and provide your favorite Datepicker. Here is a quick run down of the features: \r\n\r\n* pagable and sortable tabular interface\r\n* interceptor design pattern for adding custom display and update features\r\n* only 200 lines of code\r\n* relies on jquery, underscore, underscore templates and of course parse.com\r\n\r\n![table](http://www.brenthamby.com/dt.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@brenthamby\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
